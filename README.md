This is a VS Code extension designed to enable AI agents to interact with VS Code's debugging capabilities through a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, achieving an automated and intelligent debugging experience. Assisted development using [RooCode](https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code).

## ‚ú® Features

*   **ü§ñ AI-Driven Debugging**:
    *   Allows AI agents to perform standard VS Code debugging operations through the MCP tool interface.
    *   **Debug Configurations**: Reads the project's `launch.json` file to get available debug configurations.
    *   **Breakpoint Management**: Set, remove, and query breakpoints, supporting regular breakpoints, conditional breakpoints, hit count breakpoints, and log points.
    *   **Execution Control**: Start debugging sessions (`launch` or `attach` mode), continue execution (`Continue`), step through code (`Step Over`, `Step Into`, `Step Out`), and stop debugging sessions.
    *   **(Future)** Inspect variable values, traverse the call stack, evaluate expressions in specific contexts, etc.
*   **‚öôÔ∏è MCP Server Management**:
    *   **Status Bar Integration**: Displays the real-time running status of the MCP server in the VS Code status bar (e.g., "Debug-MCP: Running" or "Debug-MCP: Stopped").
    *   **Convenient Control**: Click the status bar item to quickly start or stop the MCP server.
    *   **Port Configuration**: Automatically detects port occupancy. If the default port is occupied, allows the user to manually specify a new port number, which will be persistently saved.
    *   **Auto Start**: Configurable option to automatically start the MCP server when VS Code launches.
    *   **Client Configuration**: Provides a one-click copy function to easily copy the configuration information (such as URL, port) required to connect to this MCP server to AI clients (e.g., ClaudeDesktop, RooCode, Cline, Cursor, etc.).
*   **üì° Communication Protocol**:
    *   The VS Code extension communicates with the local MCP server via subprocess and IPC.
    *   The MCP server communicates with AI clients using **HTTP + Server-Sent Events (SSE)**, ensuring real-time and reliability.

## üöÄ Requirements

*   **Visual Studio Code**: ^1.85.0 or higher.
*   **Node.js**: ^18.0.0 or higher (for running the MCP server).
*   **How to Install Node.js**: Please visit the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/) to download and install the version suitable for your operating system.
*   **AI Client**: An AI agent client that supports the Model Context Protocol.

## üìñ Usage Guide

Taking RooCode as an example:
1. Search and install the extension in the VS Code Extensions Marketplace.
2. Confirm that the MCP server is running. ![PixPin_2025-04-25_18-27-06](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82c51c61-0e8c-472f-90f3-bf19d5364f20)
3. Copy the configuration to the RooCode MCP configuration file. ![PixPin_2025-04-25_18-25-22](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/677e7547-bace-40c2-b9fe-9b68be09a784)
4. Before each use, check if RooCode is connected to the MCP server. ![PixPin_2025-04-25_18-30-48](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2379585d-fbaa-48dc-aa0d-50204a9db1d1)

## üîß Extension Settings

This extension provides the following VS Code settings (`settings.json`):

*   `vscode-debugger-mcp.server.port` (number): The port number the MCP server listens on. Defaults to `6009`.
*   `vscode-debugger-mcp.server.autoStart` (boolean): Whether to automatically start the MCP server when VS Code launches. Defaults to `true`.

## üêû Known Issues / Potential Issues

*   Only simple tests have been done with the RooCode client. It is unclear how it works with other clients.

### Logs and Error Information

If you find errors, you can view the logs in the VS Code Output panel for easier feedback and issue reporting.

*   Extension and Simulated Client Logs: ![jtnqbb.png](https://files.catbox.moe/jtnqbb.png)

## üîÆ Future Development Plan

*   **Variable and Scope Inspection**:
    *   Implement `get_scopes` tool: Get scopes (e.g., local variables, global variables) for a specified stack frame.
    *   Implement `get_variables` tool: Get a list of variables and their values for a specified scope or expandable variable.
*   **Expression Evaluation**:
    *   Implement `evaluate_expression` tool: Evaluate an expression in the context of a specified stack frame.
*   **Internationalization**
*   *   Translate tooltips to English.
*   *   English version of README images and usage guide.
